Me: Hello [Hey, hi]
bot: it doesn't look like we've spoken before...
bot: would you like to know what I do?
    Me: Yes
    bot: I help you setup and achieve your goals, here's how...
    bot: first I ask a few questions about your goals...
    bot: then I ask you to set a daily goal, something you can do every day that'll help you achieve a bigger goal...
    bot: does that make sense?
        Me: yes
        bot: great, let's get started
        
        Me: No
        bot: hmmmm, maybe it's best to illustrate with an example...
        bot: imagine you want to lose weight (who doesn't right? :-))
        bot: lose weight is the long term goal, so...
        bot: now you should think about the things you're going to do on a daily basis to achieve the long term goal...
        bot: so you might say, I'm going to make sure I don't eat after 6pm every day
        bot: in which case the daily goal is to not eat after 6pm...
        bot: my job is to ask you, at a time you designate, did you do your best to not eat after 6pm today...
        bot: now it's up to you to reflect on your effort for the day...
        bot: give yourself a score between 1 and 10 - 1 being I emtied the fridge at 7:05, 10 being I've not eaten a scrap since 5.30pm today.
        bot: hopefully that makes more sense, the best way to learn is to do, so, let's get started!

    Me: No
    bot: great, let's get started
